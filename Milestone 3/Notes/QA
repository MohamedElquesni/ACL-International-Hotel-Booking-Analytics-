- [] Will there be model answer for MS2
- [] How many intents are required ? 
- [] Our Intent good enough in terms of number and quality? 
  1. hotel_search - Find hotels by location/rating
  2. hotel_recommendation - Get personalized hotel suggestions

    - Search results (only 1 option per location)
    - Recommendations (very limited choices)
  - Can/should you augment with external data? The README says you're allowed to integrate external datasets
    Or is this limitation acceptable for grading purposes?
- [] Should the model do something extra than Question and answer?
- [] Quantitative evaluation: What specific metrics should you use for:
    - Overall system performance?
    - Intent classification accuracy?
    - Retrieval quality?
    - Baseline for comparison: What should you compare your embedding approaches against?
    
- [] Difference between feature based and Node based embedded
